# BibTeX reference list

Inspired by [this post](http://markelikalderon.com/2008/06/17/gitting-bibtex/) I have
decided to start managing my BibTeX reference file(s) using git, keeping a public 
copy on github.

So far, the contents have an emphasis on extreme value statistics
and operational risk, which reflects a consulting project I am
working on. I will be adding other files, but have not yet decided
whether to keep them in one big .bib file or to have them separated
by subject.
