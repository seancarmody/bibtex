		  two parameters in the reliability model, such as the model
		  using Weibull distribution, then maximum likelihood
		  estimation of parameters becomes a difficult problem. Mao
		  and Chen published a real data set of the lifetime of a
		  certain type of bearings which only contains one failure
		  data. They used a Bayesian method to analyze the data and
		  obtained some results for model parameter estimation.
		  However, in their method the choice of prior distribution
		  will affect heavily the final results. In this paper, we
		  propose a Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm to estimate
		  reliability model parameters using the Weibull
		  distribution. Based on the same data set of Mao and Chen,
		  we obtain some results using the MCEM algorithm. Our
		  results do not depend on the choice of arbitrary prior
		  distributions.},

		  observations to use for modeling and estimating tail
		  parameters of the banks' operational loss distribution. By
		  means of three copula functions, we calculated correlations
		  between event pairs, tested for independence between
		  different classifications of risk types in the Basel II
		  framework and sought to understand the characteristics and
		  concentration of commercial banks' operational risks.
		  Further, we estimated parameters for the generalized Pareto
		  distribution and compared its fit with those of standard
		  parametric models. A bootstrap method was used to estimate
		  confidence intervals for the parameter values. In addition,
		  value-at-risk and expected shortfall calculations were
		  performed. Our results provide important information that
		  financial supervisory authorities can use when accounting

  abstract	= {According to Basel II criteria, the use of external data
		  is absolutely indispensable to the implementation of an
		  advanced method for calculating operational capital. This
		  article investigates how the severity and frequencies of
		  external losses are scaled for integration with internal
		  data. We set up an initial model designed to explain the
		  loss severity. This model takes into account firm size,
		  location, and business lines as well as risk types. It also
		  shows how to calculate the internal loss equivalent to an
		  external loss, which might occur in a given bank. OLS
		  estimation results show that the above variables have
		  significant power in explaining the loss amount. They are
		  used to develop a normalization formula. A second model
		  based on external data is developed to scale the frequency
		  of losses over a given period. Two regression models are
		  analyzed: the truncated Poisson model and the truncated
		  negative binomial model. Variables estimating the size and
		  geographical distribution of the banks' activities have
		  been introduced as explanatory variables. The results show
		  that the negative binomial distribution outperforms the
		  Poisson distribution. The scaling is done by calculating
		  the parameters of the selected distribution based on the
		  estimated coefficients and the variables related to a given
		  bank. Frequency of losses of more than $1 million are
		  generated on a specific horizon.},

  abstract	= {L-moments are expectations of certain linear combinations
		  of order statistics. They can be defined for any random
		  variable whose mean exists and form the basis of a general
		  theory which covers the summarization and description of
		  theoretical probability distributions, the summarization
		  and description of observed data samples, estimation of
		  parameters and quantiles of probability distributions, and
		  hypothesis tests for probability distributions. The theory
		  involves such established procedures as the use of order
		  statistics and Gini's mean difference statistic, and gives
		  rise to some promising innovations such as the measures of
		  skewness and kurtosis described in section 2, and new
		  methods of parameter estimation for several distributions.
		  The theory of L-moments parallels the theory of
		  (conventional) moments, as the above list of applications
		  might suggest. The main advantage of L-moments over
		  conventional moments is that L-moments, being linear
		  functions of the data, suffer less from the effects of
		  sampling variability: L-moments are more robust than
		  conventional moments to outliers in the data and enable
		  more secure inferences to be made from small samples about
		  an underlying probability distribution. L-moments sometimes
		  yield more efficient parameter estimates than the
		  maximum-likelihood estimates.},

		  In this paper, we analyze data from a very large US bank
		  and show that it could suffer, on average, more than four
		  major losses a year. The bank had seven losses exceeding
		  hundreds of millions of dollars among its 52 documented
		  losses of more than US$1 million over the 1994-2004 period.
		  The tail of the loss distribution predicts that this bank
		  is in danger of experiencing extreme operational losses
		  ranging from $1 billion (with 1\% probability) to \$11
		  billion (0.1\% probability). The corresponding annual
		  insurance premiums are estimated to range from $350 million
		  to almost \$1 billion.},
